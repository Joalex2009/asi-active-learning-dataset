The core takeaway isn’t simply *using* AI, but a fundamental shift in *how* we think about intelligence – moving beyond a human-centric view to embrace a collaborative, relational model. This isn’t about replacing human cognition, but augmenting it, creating a “symbiotic intelligence” where human intuition, creativity, and ethical judgment are interwoven with AI’s analytical power and processing speed. Crucially, success hinges on designing systems that foster trust, transparency, and shared understanding, prioritizing human agency and ensuring equitable access to this evolving partnership. Ultimately, we’re witnessing the emergence of a new form of intelligence – one that’s fundamentally shaped by interaction and co-creation."
