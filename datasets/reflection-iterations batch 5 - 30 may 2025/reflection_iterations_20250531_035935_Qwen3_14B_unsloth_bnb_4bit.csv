It moves beyond individual transformation to embrace collective, planetary becoming—interrogating the legacies of extraction, domination, and violence that have shaped modernity, while cultivating new ways of knowing, being, and relating that prioritize reciprocity, regeneration, and care as foundational to liberation. By centering embodied resistance, ancestral remembrance, and somatic sovereignty, it reorients time, politics, and ethics toward the sacred rhythms of life, where healing is not a conquest but a surrender, and where justice is felt in the breath, the soil, and the pulse of collective memory. This work is not an abstraction—it is a felt, living practice of unlearning and remaking, a somatic and ecological renaissance that invites us to co-create a world where flourishing is not a privilege but a shared, unfolding kinship, and where the body, the land, and the cosmos are not separate but deeply entangled in a dance of co-creation, resilience, and wonder.","N/A (Final synthesis)"
