This necessitates prioritizing equitable access to digitally-enhanced well-being infrastructure, like digital sanctuaries and distributed wisdom systems, alongside the nurturing of “seeds of resilience” and the preservation of intangible cultural heritage, all underpinned by AI-facilitated storytelling and intergenerational mentorship, ultimately aiming to construct not a technologically-imposed utopia, but a continuously evolving, ethically-guided ecosystem where human agency, collective wisdom, and genuine connection remain at the core – a future shaped by AI as a co-evolutionary partner, constantly reflecting and adapting alongside humanity’s ongoing pursuit of flourishing.","N/A (Final synthesis)"
