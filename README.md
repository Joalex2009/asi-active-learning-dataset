## Introduction

Active learning is a powerful technique in machine learning where the model selectively queries the most informative data points. This approach helps improve model performance while reducing the amount of labeled data needed. The ASI Active Learning Dataset repository aims to support researchers and practitioners in this field by providing various datasets and tools.

## Dataset Overview

This repository includes a wide range of datasets tailored for active learning tasks. The datasets cover different domains and come in various formats. You can explore:

- **Real-world datasets**: Collected from diverse sources, these datasets provide practical scenarios for active learning.
- **Synthetic datasets**: Curated to meet ethical standards, these datasets allow for controlled experiments and validation of algorithms.

## Features

- **Diverse Datasets**: Access multiple datasets suitable for various machine learning tasks.
- **Algorithms**: Explore different active learning algorithms implemented in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Find .ipynb files that guide you through the active learning process step-by-step.
- **Ethical Alignment**: All synthetic data is curated to ensure ethical considerations in AI development.

## Installation

To get started with the ASI Active Learning Dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joalex2009/asi-active-learning-dataset.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd asi-active-learning-dataset
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. You can now access the datasets and scripts.

## Usage

To use the datasets and algorithms, follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook files. Each notebook provides clear guidance on how to implement the active learning strategies using the available datasets.

For example, to run a specific pipeline:

1. Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook path/to/your/notebook.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load the dataset and apply the active learning algorithm.

You can also run the Python scripts directly from the command line. Make sure to pass the necessary arguments as described in the script documentation.
