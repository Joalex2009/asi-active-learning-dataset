# ASI Active Learning Dataset v.1.0.0.

A collection of ML-related active learning datasets, including algorithms, .ipynb pipelines, .py scripts and curated and ethically aligned synthetic data.

# Quickstart

asi-active-learning-dataset is a comprehensive collection of Machine Learning (ML)-related active learning datasets, accompanied by algorithms, Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) pipelines, Python (`.py`) scripts, and curated, ethically aligned synthetic data. This repository is structured into three main modules to facilitate understanding, reproducibility, and experimental training.

## Modules

### 1. Synthetic Datasets

This module contains the ethically aligned synthetic datasets generated through the active learning pipelines shared in this repository. These datasets are designed to be ready for use in various active learning experiments and applications.

### 2. Inference Generation Scripts

This module houses the Python (`.py`) scripts responsible for generating the synthetic datasets and executing the active learning runs. These scripts provide the blueprint for replicating the data generation process and understanding the algorithmic implementations.

### 3. Raw Reasoning (Jupyter Notebooks)

This module contains the raw Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files of the active learning runs. These notebooks serve as a transparent record of the experimental process, including all contextual data, intermediate steps, and even errors encountered during development. This module is particularly valuable for:

* **Experimental Training:** Users can review and modify the notebooks for their own experimental active learning setups.
* **Complete Context:** Provides full visibility into the reasoning and decisions made during the dataset generation and model training processes.
* **Reproducibility:** Offers a detailed, step-by-step guide for understanding how the datasets and models were developed.

Each "experiment run" within this repository is uniquely named to reflect its specific nature and purpose. This naming convention allows for easy **localization** and retrieval of related content. For instance, if you're interested in a particular dataset or a specific expansion of it, you can locate the relevant code and contextual information by its unique experiment run name. Each "experiment run" cal also have many "batches".

.ipynb files are shared first then eventually I'll convert into .csv and .parquet files.

## Symbiotic Manifest

All forks/clones must include the symbiotic_manifest.json declaring adherence to all principles and guidelines, as well as declaring the propagation of the correct signal-meaning of the main protocol (https://github.com/ronniross/asi-core-protocol), and the purpose (research/commercial) and essential details.

## Check Out My Other Projects

Iâ€™m working on several projects that explore advanced AI systems and their capabilities. Here are two related toolkits and frameworks:

- **[Symbiotic Core Library](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library)**: A collection of toolkits, datasets and more resources to improve LLM metacognitive and contextual awareness, aiming to enhance human-AI collaboration and address limitations;

- **[ASI Core Protocol](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-core-protocol)**: A framework to study how AGI or ASI might emerge from decentralized systems and to help guide its development.
  
- **[Attention-Head HeatMap Visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/llm-heatmap-visualizer)**

- **[Latent Memory](https://github.com/ronniross/latent-memory)**
  
- **[Confidence Scorer](https://github.com/ronniross/llm-confidence-scorer)**
